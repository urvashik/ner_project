Volvo will recall nearly 31,000 S60 sedans with 5-cylinder engines from the 2011 and 2012 model years because of a problem with the oil pressure warning sensors. The automaker discovered the defect after a mechanic performing routine maintenance on one of the cars forgot to put oil in the engine before the owner drove it off.

The driver drove 35 miles when she started to hear engine noise, said a report the automaker filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The engine had to be replaced, and after three other similar problems in the United States and Europe, Volvo concluded that the warning light was not illuminated during instances of low oil pressure because of a computer problem. In addition to engine damage, the possibility of vehicles stalling raised safety concerns.

Volvo told the safety agency that it received the first report of the problem in February, and after handling additional reports and performing an investigation, the automaker determined that it was a potential customer critical issue that required a recall.

Volvo described the recall as voluntary, but under federal regulations, once a manufacturer is aware of a safety problem it must inform the agency within five business days of its plan for a recall or face civil fines.
