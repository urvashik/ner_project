The best in German engineering (in terms of soccer) had a trophy in its hands and a new Spanish driver. What could Bayern Munich and Coach Pep Guardiola possibly do for an encore?

Guardiola, one of the men who took Barcelona to the top in recent years, replaced Jupp Heynckes at Bayern Munich for the 2013-14 Bundesliga season. Guardiola has kept the team at the top of the standings  it is undefeated so far this season  and by winning the Club World Cup in December in Morocco, he added another piece of silverware to Bayerns bulging trophy case.

In 2013 alone, the club won the Bundesliga title, the UEFA Champions League, the German Cup and the UEFA Super Cup (while losing its only final to rival Borussia Dortmund in the preseason German Super Cup).

The numbers were quite staggering: Munich won all 17 of its home Bundesliga games, equaling the record of the 1972 and 2005 teams, and became the only team in the leagues 51-year history not to lose a Bundesliga game in a calendar year, going unbeaten in 41 matches.

The highlight among many came on a balmy May night at Wembley Stadium in London, where Bayern Munich erased the disappointment of a year earlier  when it lost the Champions League title to Chelsea on penalty kicks in its home stadium  by beating Dortmund on Arjen Robbens late goal.

For me, it was the perfect night, Robben said, adding: It was like a fairy tale: winning at Wembley and scoring in the last minute. It cant get any better.

But can it?

Bayern Munich is now trying to extend its brand outside Germany. It recently opened an office in New York, and after next years World Cup, it will travel to Portland, Ore., to face a team of All-Stars from Major League Soccer.

Weve worked very hard, indeed, for many years, the Bayern captain Philipp Lahm said on the clubs website. Weve earned the reward in 2013.
