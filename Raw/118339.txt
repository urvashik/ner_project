SEATTLE  The Seahawks say they sold out of playoff tickets in less than 30 minutes.

The team sold a limited number of tickets on Tuesday morning, after giving season ticket holders first dibs on the seats they have occupied all season.

The game on Jan. 11 at 1:35 p.m. in Seattle is against a yet unknown opponent.

The opponent will be decided next week, and it will be the Green Bay Packers, the San Francisco 49ers or the New Orleans Saints.
