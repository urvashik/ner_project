WASHINGTON  The White House says it is disappointed that peace talks in Northern Ireland have ended without an agreement.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the talks did represent progress and urged Northern Ireland's political leaders to continue to work together. She says continued dialogue can help the parties find a path forward to overcome sectarian divisions.

The talks broke down early Tuesday, with leaders failing to reach an accord on key issues including the use of flags and parades. Those issues are causes of continuing disputes between Protestants and Catholics.
