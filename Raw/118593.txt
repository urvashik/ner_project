It was a great Stanley Cup final series, and now the reporters in Boston were prepared to fly back to Chicago for Game 7. The Bruins were ahead, 2-1, in Game 6 as the clock dipped below two minutes and the desperate Blackhawks pulled their goalie. The Boston crowd was roaring. The reporters were typing: The Boston Bruins beat the Chicago Blackhawks and extended the Stanley Cup to a decisive seventh game. ...

Then, boom. Bryan Bickell tied the score with 76 seconds left. At TD Garden, there was stunned silence. In the press box, the typing stopped.

And 17 seconds later, boom again. Dave Bolland scored to put the Blackhawks ahead. The only sounds were the hoots of the Blackhawks on the ice and their friends and family members scattered around the building. The Bruins fans stared, their shock not yet displaced by despair.

The reporters groaned and hit the delete button on their laptops. The final 59 seconds ticked down, the Blackhawks celebrated, the Cup was brought out, the reporters pounded out new articles, and still, no one could quite grasp what had happened.

It was the first time a team had won the Stanley Cup in regulation time by overcoming a deficit in the final two minutes. No Stanley Cup-winning goal had ever been scored later in regulation than Bollands.

This goal, this ending  nobody saw it coming, Blackhawks Coach Joel Quenneville said.

It certainly will be remembered for a long time, especially in Chicago  Bickell, Bolland and those 17 seconds that stunned the hockey world. In Boston, the feelings will linger for just as long.

Forever, Bruins defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. I mean, youre going to remember forever.
