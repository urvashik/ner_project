BRISBANE, Australia  Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki withdrew from the Brisbane International due to a stomach illness before her scheduled second-round match Wednesday against Stefanie Voegele of Switzerland.

Lisicki, seeded seventh, beat Magdalena Rybarikova in straight sets in her first-round match and another win would have put her into a quarterfinal, potentially against No. 2 Victoria Azarenka.

She's the latest withdrawal from the tournament, a key warm-up for the Australian Open, following Ashleigh Barty's withdrawal from a second-round match against four-time major winner Maria Sharapova and former No. 1-ranked Caroline Wozniacki's absence due to a sore right shoulder.

Sydney International organizers announced Wednesday that Nicolas Almagro of Spain had withdrawn from next week's tournament due to a shoulder injury.
