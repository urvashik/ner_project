NEW YORK  Bombardier Inc. said Tuesday it has received a firm order for 38 business jets with a combined list price of about $2.2 billion.

Bombardier didn't disclose the precise value of the deal  customers such as airlines routinely get discounts from plane manufacturers  and didn't identify the buyer.

The Canadian plane maker said the order covered 28 Global jets and 10 Challenger 605 aircraft. The Global line includes four models capable of carrying up to 19 passengers on flights as long as 7,900 nautical miles. The Challenger jet can carry 12 passengers and a crew of three up to 4,000 nautical miles.

Separately, Bombardier announced that its transportation division ended a contract for new signaling equipment for the London Underground. The subway system said it would re-bid a contract that was awarded to Bombardier in 2011 and valued at $577 million at the time.

The company didn't provide a detailed explanation, but The Telegraph of London reported that Bombardier determined that its signaling system wasn't compatible with the Underground's old infrastructure.

A spokeswoman for the Montreal-based company did not immediately return a call for comment.
