Mary Cain, one of the most promising female American high school middle-distance runners in decades, has chosen to turn professional rather than run for a collegiate team.

It was a difficult decision because we were looking at some wonderful programs, but at the end of the day, this was the best way for her to reach her goals, Cains father, Charles, said. This is the right time for her to come to this decision.

Cain, who will graduate from her suburban New York City high school, Bronxville, in June, was looking at several colleges on the West Coast, including the University of Portland, her father said. She has agreed to join Pace Sports Management, which represents Olympic champions like Usain Bolt, Mo Farah and Galen Rupp. Cain has not signed a deal with a shoe company.

Though Cain lives in Bronxville, Portland was a logical place for her to attend college because it would have allowed her to work closely with her coach, Alberto Salazar, who works with the Nike Oregon Project.

Cain, 17, began working with Salazar a year ago after she outgrew her high school teams. She has smashed a number of American junior indoor and outdoor middle-distance records.
