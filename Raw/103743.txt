The stock market rose on Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poors 500-stock index once again hitting nominal record highs, after Janet L. Yellen, the nominee to become chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, suggested the Feds economic stimulus would continue as long as the economy remained fragile.

Gains in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index and the Dow were held back by a sharp drop in Cisco Systems, which reported disappointing results late Wednesday.

Ms. Yellen, in testimony during her Senate confirmation hearing, acknowledged that the Feds current $85 billion in monthly bond purchases cannot continue forever, but she made clear she remained a staunch supporter of the stimulus program initiated by Ben S. Bernanke, the current Fed chairman.

Her hearing confirmed the suspicion that she will be slightly more dovish than Bernanke, said Joseph S. Tanious, Global Market Strategist at JPMorgan Funds. It reassured investors that they are unlikely to see any tapering announced this year.

The Dow rose 54.59 points, or 0.35 percent, to close at 15,876.22. The S.&P. 500 gained 8.62 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,790.62. The Nasdaq advanced 7.17 points, or 0.18 percent, to 3,972.74.

Since the beginning of the year, the S.&P. 500 has risen 25.6 percent and the Dow 21.2 percent, thanks in part to the Feds huge economic stimulus.

Shares of Cisco, the network equipment maker, had their worst day since Feb. 10, 2011, dropping $2.63, or 11 percent, to $21.37, after the company warned that its revenue would decline as much as 10 percent this quarter and continue to contract until the second half of 2014.

It caught people off guard, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at the Synovus Trust Company. I think theyre thinking that with Microsoft and other old-line technology companies doing well, that Cisco would come in and at least produce an average quarter.

The market showed little reaction to the days economic news. The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000 in the latest week. The less volatile four-week average of jobless claims dropped 5,750, to 344,000.

The Commerce Department said the nations trade deficit in September rose 8 percent, to $41.8 billion, the largest amount since May, as imports hit their highest level in almost a year.

Among the stocks on the move, Kohls, the department store chain, fell $4.71, or 8.1 percent, to $53.55 after it reported lower-than-expected quarterly results and cut its full-year earnings forecast.

Shares of Houghton Mifflin, the textbook publisher, jumped $3.86, or 32.2 percent, to $15.86 on its first day of trading after emerging from bankruptcy last year.

In the bond market, interest rates eased. The yield on the Treasurys 10-year note dropped to 2.69 percent, from 2.72 percent late Wednesday, while its price rose 15/32, to 100 16/32.
