WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  A bathroom fight on Friday among football players from Winston-Salem State and Virginia State during a pregame luncheon left the Winston-Salem quarterback beaten and a player from the other team facing charges.

The Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, a Division II conference, announced that the title game between the teams set for Saturday in Winston-Salem had been canceled. Both teams are 9-1.

Rudy Johnson, the starting quarterback for Winston-Salem, was viciously beaten by members of the Virginia State team, Winston-Salem State Chancellor Donald Reaves said in a statement.

Lamont Britt, a Virginia State running back, was being held in the Forsyth County jail on a charge of misdemeanor assault inflicting serious injury, a jail official said.

Todays event was supposed to be a celebration for both teams and for all the players who were being recognized for an outstanding season, Reaves said. The actions from the Virginia State players certainly changed the outcome for everyone.

Virginia State Athletic Director Peggy Davis did not return a phone call seeking comment, but the school issued a statement saying it was cooperating with the C.I.A.A. in its investigation and could not comment further.

The Winston-Salem Journal reported that five Virginia State players were involved, and Reaves said university police were trying to identify others.
