LOS ANGELES  Michelle Obama is leading an outpouring of support for Robin Roberts after the "Good Morning America" news anchor's first public acknowledgement of her 10-year, same-sex relationship with massage therapist Amber Laign.

The first lady wrote Monday on Twitter: "I am so happy for you and Amber! You continue to make us all proud."

In a Facebook post Sunday, Roberts thanked her "longtime girlfriend" for providing encouragement during Roberts' battle with myelodysplastic syndrome, a rare blood and bone marrow disease.

Many celebs also took to Twitter to send Roberts messages, including Ellen DeGeneres, who tweeted, "Good morning, America! Congratulations."

Comedian Wanda Sykes wrote, "Go on with your bad self!"

Country singer Chely Wright, who came out in 2010, also expressed support through the social media site.
