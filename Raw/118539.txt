Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2014 Inductees: and the winners are...

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame made its annual announcement last week. The 2014 inductees are Peter Gabriel, Nirvana, Cat Stevens, Kiss, Hall & Oates and Linda Ronstadt. Creators of boomer music. Artists become eligible 25 years after the release of their first record. Usually five to seven artists are selected based on their contributions and significant impact on the evolution and development and perpetuation of rock and roll.

Because I like to bridge the gap, and because imitation is the best form of flattery, Im offering an original and a favorite cover for each artist (or in the last case, the reverse).

Come as You Are: Nirvana and Rebecca Loebe

Rock and Roll All Nite: Kiss and Kiss

Private Eyes: Hall & Oates and the Bird and the Bee
