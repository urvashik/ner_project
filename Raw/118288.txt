SAN ANTONIO  A man is in custody after police got calls about a possible gunman at a San Antonio hospital, but officers say no shots were fired, no injuries were reported and no one saw a gun.

San Antonio police Sgt. Javier Salazar told the San Antonio Express-News (http://bit.ly/1amVY7D ) that a person of interest was apprehended Tuesday night near Methodist Stone Oak Hospital.

The hospital was on lockdown while police did room-to-room searches. Officers also shut down a couple of roads near the hospital during their investigation.

Salazar says it's unclear what charges the person could face, if any.
