The Knicks on Monday were wrapping up a deal to sign center Jeremy Tyler from their Development League affiliate, the Erie BayHawks, according to two people with knowledge of the transaction. Although the move may help the Knicks thin frontcourt, it also means the team will probably waive Chris Smith, putting a coda on a strange saga that prompted charges of nepotism.

Smith, the younger brother of J. R. Smith, made the team out of training camp after Coach Mike Woodson acknowledged that Chriss relationship with J. R. gave him an advantage.

On Monday afternoon, J. R. Smith appeared to make his feelings known by posting a photograph on his Instagram account that included the caption: You know the sad thing about betrayal? It never comes from an enemy. He was unavailable for comment, as were the Knicks.

J. R. Smith is no stranger to the dangers of social media. Earlier this season, he was fined $25,000 by the N.B.A. after he threatened the Detroit Pistons Brandon Jennings on Twitter. Jennings had posted that Chris Smith was unworthy of an N.B.A. roster spot.
