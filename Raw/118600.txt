Some posts included details; some used his name and nothing else. But anyone familiar with Stephen Curry, the streaky point guard for the Golden State Warriors, knew it was time to find a television  fast.

Those who tuned in that night in February, for a game between Currys Warriors and the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, watched one of the greatest shooting displays in N.B.A. history.

Curry started the game as a human being, but as it went along, his connection to reality was severed. By the second half, it seemed any ball that touched his hands was going to be launched toward the basket, and when he did shoot, it was probably going in.

With about five minutes left, Curry shot a 3-pointer over Raymond Felton to put the Warriors ahead, 100-99. The basket accounted for Points 47, 48 and 49 from Curry, and he went strutting down the court, his knees kicking high to his chest, his hands stretched to his sides and his eyes seeming to roll back into his head.

Draymond Green, Currys teammate, stood at midcourt with his right arm up, waiting for a high-five that never came. Curry danced right past him and all the way to the opposite baseline. Not only was he in a zone no fan could truly understand, he was not even in the same world as his teammates.

Curry finished with 54 points, going 11 for 13 from 3-point range. His was the first 50-point effort in N.B.A. history to feature 10 or more 3-pointers.

To some, Currys performance was just a great shooting night that came up short; his team lost, 109-105. But for fans capable of appreciating artistry even in defeat, the game will be remembered long after plenty of victories have been forgotten.
