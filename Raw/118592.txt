The Hadza people of Tanzania are among the last hunter-gatherer groups on earth, foraging on foot for most of their food. Now scientists have analyzed their movements and determined that they fit a mathematical pattern that also works for sharks, honeybees and other foraging animals.

The pattern, called the Lvy walk, involves a series of short movements in one area combined with a few longer treks to more distant areas.

This helps avoid repeated visits to the same spot, said an author of the study, David Raichlen, an anthropologist at the University of Arizona.

For the study, which appears in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Raichlen and his colleagues asked Hadza men and women to wear GPS wristwatches so their movements could be tracked from dawn to dusk as they hunted for meat, berries, tubers, honey and other food.

The research suggests that the Lvy walk could be fundamental to the way humans experience and move about the world, Dr. Raichlen said. Previous research has also identified the same pattern in the way people move around amusement parks and in urban environments.

Its not all that surprising when you think what we all do on a daily basis, he said. I go to work and back every day, maybe the grocery store, and then every once in a while I make a longer movement to a place farther away.
