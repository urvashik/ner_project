NEW YORK  A new report says billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent $650 million of his own fortune on New York City over the course of three terms in office.

Sorting through public documents, philanthropy databases and other records the New York Times (http://nyti.ms/KfzrTD) estimates Sunday that figure is probably low.

The newspaper says Bloomberg spent about $62,400 in 12 years for weekly cleanings of two large saltwater fish tanks in City Hall. He also made $23 million in campaign donations and has given a cool $30 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 2002.

Bloomberg, who Forbes Magazine estimates is worth $27 billion, famously took a $1 annual salary as mayor.

He's spent generously to promote gun control and other issues he's passionate about.
