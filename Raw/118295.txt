The price of gold closed out its worst year since 1981 Tuesday as the U.S. economy improved, inflation remained at bay and worries about the financial system and gridlock in Washington faded.

Gold slumped 28 percent in 2013. The price peaked at $1,900 an ounce in August 2011 and has been declining more or less steadily ever since.
