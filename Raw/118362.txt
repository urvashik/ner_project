CHENNAI, India  Russian qualifier Alexander Kudryavtsev knocked out eighth-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain on Tuesday to reach the second round of the Chennai Open.

Kudryavtsev earned a hard-fought 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over Agut, who had a memorable run here last year when he knocked out top-seeded Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals and stretched eventual winner Janko Tipsarevic to three sets in the final.

In another tough three-setter that lasted almost 2  hours, Aljaz Bedene of Slovenia hit eight aces as he outlasted Henri Laaksonen of Switzerland 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (0).

In a surprise result that had the home crowd cheering, Indian wild-card entry Yuki Bhambri beat up-and-coming Spanish player Carreno Busta 6-4, 6-3.

Bhambri went for the lines against an opponent who failed to live up to expectations after rising from 715 to a career-best ranking of 64th last season, earning him the ATP's most improved player of the year award.

Bhambri next plays Fabio Fognini of Italy, who hopes to recover from a leg strain he sustained while partnering Indian veteran Leander Paes in the doubles competition.

Seventh-seeded Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin, Benjamin Becker of Germany and Indian qualifier Ramkumar Ramanathan were among the others to advance.
