Apparently, cable drama can survive outside Sunday night: AMC announced Thursday that it had ordered a new season of its cowboy drama Hell on Wheels, which was moved to Saturday nights this season.

That move had been questioned, because to some in the television business, a shift to Saturday always signals exile leading to cancellation. But AMC had defended the move as consistent with its overall program planning for Saturday, which is where the network consistently runs the Western movies in its library.

The new season order is even more of a vote of confidence in Hell on Wheels because the next season will expand to 13 episodes, up from 10 this season.

AMC said the audience for the show increased this season even after the move to Saturdays, reaching 3.3 million viewers (after delayed viewing is counted). That was up from just over three million the previous season when the show played on Sunday nights.
