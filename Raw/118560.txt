After a rush of 11th-hour interest, 230,624 people had enrolled in either private or public insurance through New York States health insurance exchange by the Dec. 24 deadline, qualifying them for coverage on the first day of the new year, state officials said on Monday.

The burst of interest in New York continued even after the deadline, with enrollments rising to 241,522 as of Monday, officials said.

Of those enrollments, 175,146 are in private commercial insurance plans, and 66,376 are in Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, which has spurred enrollment by raising its income limit.

Enrollment in the exchanges remains open through March 31. According to federal rules, individuals who apply by the 15thof the month will have insurance coverage on the first day of the following month, but the original Dec. 15 deadline for Jan. 1 coverage was extended because of early troubles on the website of the federal health exchange.

About 75 percent of those enrolling in individual plans on the New York exchange qualify for a subsidy to reduce the cost of coverage.

New York has surpassed the goal set by the federal government of 102,500 sign-ups by Dec. 31.

The federal goal for the March 31 enrollment deadline is 218,000 sign-ups for private insurance, as set forward in a September memo from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.

The state set a goal of 1.1 million enrollments by the end of 2016, and said it is on track to meet that goal.

Nationally, enrollment is running behind the 3.3 million for December and 7 million for March targeted in the September memo. After struggling with technical glitches, the federal exchange enrolled more than 975,000 people in private insurance in December alone, bringing the total to 1.1 million since it opened on Oct. 1, federal officials said on Monday.

In Connecticut, 34,295 people had enrolled in private plans through the states health insurance exchange, Access Health CT, as of Dec. 23, state officials said.

The exchange had enrolled about 1,000 more people than the goal set for the state through March, becoming the first state, officials said, to exceed the goals set out in the September memo.
