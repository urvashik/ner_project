The top 20 movies at U.S. and Canadian theaters Friday through Sunday, followed by distribution studio, gross, number of theater locations, average receipts per location, total gross and number of weeks in release, as compiled Monday by Rentrak, are:

1. "The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug," Warner Bros., $29,040,000, 3,928 locations, $7,393 average, $189,494,000, 3 weeks.
