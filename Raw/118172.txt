For Wall Street, 2013 will go down as the Year of the Big Fine.

Five years after all those bailouts for big banks, major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America agreed to pay many billions of dollars in fines this year to settle claims involving a range of wrongdoing, from questionable mortgage practices to trading fiascos.

Others corporate titans have paid out, too. Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $2.2 billion to settle claims that the company marketed a drug for unproved uses and paid kickbacks to doctors. Another big drug company, Glaxo SmithKline, agreed to pay $3 billion and pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it illegally marketed drugs.

The list goes on. But amid all the headlines  and there have been many in recent years  the question remains: Do big fines actually prompt corporations to mend their ways? Many ordinary people certainly want companies to be held accountable. But for corporations, fines sometimes seem like the cost of doing business. That is because the costs often pale next to the profits that companies stand to make by doing the things that get them into trouble in the first place

Whats more, the penalties often come years after the supposed infractions came to light.

Youd really like to see the fine in an immediate way such that it is really very observable, says David F. Larcker, a law professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, but even if its years later  once you go in there and do the analysis  you might find out the same practices are still going.

Documents pile up, dockets get filled. In the meantime, policies and personnel can change  although the top executives rarely get thrown out. And keep in mind: The billions that companies are paying belong to their owners  the shareholders  not to executives.
