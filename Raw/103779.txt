The North American Open Pairs Flight A final takes place next March, in the two days before the Spring North American Championships get into full swing in Dallas.

The districts of the American Contract Bridge League run qualifying competitions. The winners of the District 24 (New York City and Long Island) event were Jared Lilienstein and Michael Polowan. This was their third victory in six attempts. They finished 0.56 matchpoints ahead of R. Jay Becker and Brian Glubok. Third were David Gurvich and Ron Haack (all of New York City).

Winning a bridge event usually involves playing accurately, taking the opportunities that are offered. It rarely requires brilliant coups. The diagramed deal from the final session is typical.

North-South overreached to four hearts. Polowan (West) led the spade ace. Lilienstein (East) encouraged with his seven.

West shifted to the club ten and East captured dummys king with his ace.

East, correctly deducing that his partner must have led a singleton, returned the spade deuce, his lowest remaining spade being a suit-preference signal for clubs. West ruffed and returned a club. East won with his queen and gave his partner a second ruff for down two.

Plus 200 was worth 14 matchpoints out of 17. If Lilienstein and Polowan had mistimed the defense slightly and been only plus 100, they would have gained 9.5 matchpoints and been relegated to second.

The World University Online Bridge Championships start in January. Organized by the International University Sports Federation and the World Bridge Federation, the events are played over the Internet.
