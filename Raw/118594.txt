The Entrepreneurial Finance Lab uses a psychometric test to help banks decide whether to lend money in developing economies to small entrepreneurs who otherwise might have no access to credit.

To determine the individuals potential ability to pay back the loan, it asks questions about business skills and what is called fluid intelligence.

To discover the persons willingness to pay the debt, other questions drive at ethics, as well as attitudes and beliefs. In general, there are no right or wrong answers. Following are some examples of questions posed to applicants:

BUSINESS SKILLS Which of the following should you take into account when calculating costs? Check all that apply.

ETHICS AND HONESTY How many suppliers do you think cheat their customers?

ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS A big part of success is luck.
