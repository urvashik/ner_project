NEW YORK  "Duck Dynasty" star Willie Robertson chose not to quack back.

Given a chance to comment on the dust-up surrounding his outspoken father and co-star Phil Robertson, the younger Robertson had only kind words for the A&E network and New Year's wishes for the nation in an appearance Tuesday night on Fox News's "All-American New Year" special.

Asked about the controversy while appearing live with wife Korie from Steamboat Springs, Colo., Willie Robertson said "A&E and us are fine," and "we're ready to move on" and get "back to making some funny shows."

Phil Robertson was suspended for nine days over anti-gay comments he made in GQ magazine. A firestorm resulted among his legions of defenders who felt he was being censored by the network, which reinstated him Friday.
