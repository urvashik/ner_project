COLUMBUS, Ohio  A former Ohio man accused of cheating Miami Heat basketball players and others of millions of dollars has indicated he'll plead guilty to fraud and other charges.

An indictment describes a scheme under which Haider Zafar (HY'-dur ZAH'-fahr) allegedly swindled a Washington, D.C., businessman out of $10 million between 2008 and 2010.

A witness who testified against Zafar in August alleged Zafar also defrauded Heat players, including former forward Mike Miller. The players aren't mentioned in the criminal complaint, but Zafar's deal includes his willingness to resolve a possible investigation in Florida.

In documents filed Tuesday in federal court in Columbus, Zafar agrees to plead guilty to 30 counts and to forfeit $10 million.

Zafar's attorney says his client wants to tie up all loose ends in the case.
