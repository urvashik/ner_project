Police in a Milwaukee suburb shot and wounded a man brandishing a handgun inside a childrens hospital on Thursday after officers had tried to arrest him on a warrant inside the hospitals neonatal care unit, the authorities said. No one else was injured during the shooting.

The man, whose name has not been released by the authorities, had been holding an infant inside Childrens Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa when Milwaukee police officers approached him and told him he was under arrest for an outstanding weapons charge, said David Clarke, sheriff of Milwaukee County.

The man put the child down and appeared to be willing to cooperate with the officers when he suddenly fled down a hallway with a drawn handgun, Sheriff Clarke said.

He turned around several times with the weapon in his hand, Sheriff Clarke said.

The officers fired several shots, striking the gunman, the authorities said. The man was taken to a nearby hospital. His injuries are not life-threatening, officials said.

Sheriff Clarke would not say whether the man had fired his weapon, and he also declined to discuss why officers had chosen to arrest him inside a hospital. It was also unclear how close the shooting  which occurred on the hospitals seventh floor  had been to children being treated and hospital staff members. But he said the authorities would conduct an investigation into the shooting.

Warrants are executed in all kinds of places, Sheriff Clarke said. They didnt know he was armed today.
