The Greater New York Bridge Associations Edgar Kaplan Winter Regional at the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan began on Thursday and ends Monday.

The winners of the Jim Becker A/X Pairs on the first day were David Moss of New York City and James Scott of Wilton, Conn. They finished half a board ahead of Augie Boehm and Donald Simmons of New York City. Third were Migry Zur Campanile of New York City and Nancy Katz of Carolina, P.R.

The winners got an excellent result from the diagramed deal, which occurred during the second session.

In the auction, Norths three-club rebid was an artificial major-suit inquiry.

Against six hearts, West led his lowest club. East won with his ace and returned a club to dummys queen. The only concern for Moss (South) was the trump suit. He was originally planning to play low to his ace, followed by a finesse of dummys jack. But when he led a heart to his ace, East played the ten and West the deuce.

What was Easts original holding? If queen-ten-nine, the contract had no chance. So was it a singleton ten, or from queen-ten-doubleton or ten-nine-doubleton, or a falsecard from ten-five-doubleton?

Still unsure what to do, declarer led another heart and West played the nine.

This unexpected occurrence ruled out Easts having ten-nine-doubleton. So, had East found an interesting ten from ten-five-doubleton or had West played the nine from nine-five-deuce?

After some thought, Moss put up dummys king to drop Easts queen.

Plus 1,430 was worth 20 out of 25 match points. (Three pairs had made six no-trump with an overtrick and two made that contract exactly.) Minus 100 would have produced only 2.5 match points, leaving Moss and Scott in second place behind Boehm and Simmons.
