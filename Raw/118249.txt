NEW YORK  Bon Jovi not only has the year's top tour, but the rock band has achieved a career high.

The New Jersey-based act's worldwide tour grossed $259.5 million this year, topping Pollstar's annual top 20 list and setting a record for the band itself.

Beyonce is second with $188.6 million. She ended her tour last week in Brooklyn, N.Y. Pink, Justin Bieber, and Bruce Springsteen round out the top five.

The global concert business scored a record year with the top 20 tours, earning $2.43 billion in primary ticket sales. It generated $1.96 billion last year.

The top 20 list also included Taylor Swift, Elton John, Rihanna, Depeche Mode and One Direction. The Rolling Stones' comeback tour ranked twelfth, a notch under Paul McCartney.
