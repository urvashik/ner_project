The first $1 million Caplow Childrens Prize was won by a Pakistani pediatrician who hopes to save hundreds of newborns in one Karachi neighborhood.

Dr. Anita Zaidi, one of the first doctors trained by Pakistans Aga Khan University and who has additional degrees from Duke and Harvard, beat 550 other entries, including those from major charities like Doctors Without Borders.

The neighborhood she plans to help, Rehri Goth, is a fishing village facing a mangrove swamp. Even though it is within the borders of Pakistans financial capital, one of the worlds largest cities, its residents are so poor and so cut off from medical care that 11 percent of local children die before age 5  usually during birth or in the first month after it.

The population lives in scattered clusters and is very poorly linked to public transport, Dr. Zaidi said. Most cannot afford any kind of private transportation, so mothers are forced to give birth at home. If a crisis like obstructed labor or hemorrhage develops, little can be done.

Many people dont realize the huge role that good maternal care at the time of delivery has in saving childrens lives, she added.

With the prize money, she will train midwives and set up a transportation network to get mothers in birth crises to hospitals. She will also try to change prejudices that some families harbor against hospitals, and get food and vitamins for mothers and vaccines for children.

The new prize was created by Ted Caplow, an entrepreneur whose triplets, born prematurely in 2012, spent a month in intensive care.
