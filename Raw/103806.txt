Volkswagen will recall about 62,000 Tiguan sport utility vehicles from the 2009-11 model years because they can lose exterior lighting, the automaker informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The action is part of a worldwide 2.6 million vehicle recall for lighting and transmission problems, Volkswagen announced Thursday morning in Germany.

Prompted by complaints from 26 owners, N.H.T.S.A. opened an investigation into the lighting problem on Nov. 4.

In a report to the safety agency, also on Thursday, Volkswagen said the problem stemmed from a fuse socket that could overheat and cause a partial loss, but not a complete failure, of the vehicles exterior lighting. However, some owners had complained to the agency of a complete loss of exterior lights.

Volkswagen is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem, the automaker said.

Volkswagen will also recall 3,900 Jetta hybrids from the 2013-14 model years equipped with direct-shift automatic transmissions  with a DQ200 designation in the United States  the automaker reported to N.H.T.S.A. Volkswagen says the synthetic fluid used in the gearbox can cause electrical problems by allowing corrosion of the internal lead frame of the gearbox. That could cause a loss of power to the front wheels. The synthetic fluid will be replaced with a mineral-based oil.

The 2013-14 Jetta hybrid is the only vehicle Volkswagen sells in the United States that uses the DQ200 transmission, Mark Gillies, a VW spokesman, said in an interview.

The worldwide recall includes about 800 Tiguans, about 200,000 Amarok pickup trucks and 1.6 million vehicles equipped with the DQ200 transmission, the automaker said. Many of the vehicles were sold in China.
