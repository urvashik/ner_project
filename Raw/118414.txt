ROME  An envelope addressed to an Interior Ministry official in Naples has exploded while being opened, slightly injuring a secretary in the prefect's office.

Francesco Esposito, who heads the prefect's Cabinet in the southern Italian city, told reporters the explosion on Tuesday caused an eyebrow and arm injury to the secretary.

There were no immediate claims of responsibility, and police were conducting an investigation.

The prefect is a local official of the Interior Ministry, which controls the national state police force.
