TRIPOLI, Libya  Libyan security officials say attacks in the restive eastern city of Benghazi have killed a senior police officer and wounded his guard and another officer.

The officials say Lt. Col. Hamad al-Amami was in his car late on Sunday night near his home in the city's al-Salam district when gunmen opened fire, killing him and wounding his guard.

The officials say gunmen shot and seriously wounded another police officer in the same district. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations.

The attacks were the latest in a wave of assassinations and bombings that have targeted police and army officers in Benghazi in recent months. The city is a stronghold of militias with roots in the rebel brigades that fought against late dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
