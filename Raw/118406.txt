SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  Puerto Rico police say nearly a dozen Haitian migrants and one Cuban were found stranded on a tiny island just west of the U.S. territory.

Police said in a statement Tuesday that one Haitian drowned in an attempt to reach the island of Mona.

Police said the U.S. Coast Guard is still trying to find his body.

U.S. Coast Guard officials said they could not immediately comment because the investigation is ongoing. Police said the group was apparently left stranded on Monday.

The announcement comes nearly a week after at least 17 people died when a Haitian migrant vessel capsized as it was being towed toward the Turks and Caicos Islands.
