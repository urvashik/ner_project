General Motors will recall 14,909 Chevrolet Malibus from the 2013 model year in the United States equipped with the eight-way power front seat and passenger seat option. G.M. says that in certain vehicles, the wiring harness may wear against the frame. If this happens, the insulation of a circuit on the wiring harness may become worn through to the conductor and a short to the grounded seat frame may occur.

Depending on the circuit, this may result in an open circuit breaker, unintended movement of the seat, sparking, flickering lights, melted wiring, smoke or a fire in an unattended vehicle. G.M. told N.H.T.S.A. that it was aware of two unattended fires that extinguished on their own. There are no known crashes or injuries associated with this condition. Dealers will inspect and repair the wiring harness if necessary at no charge.

G.M. will also recall almost 43,000 Chevrolet Malibus from the 2014 model year because a malfunction could prevent the windshield defrost feature from working, the automaker announced Friday.
