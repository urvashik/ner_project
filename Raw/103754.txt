BERLIN  For the first time in modern German history, a former president, Christian Wulff, went on trial on Thursday in a state court in Hanover, charged with illegally accepting favors while he was governor of the state of Lower Saxony.

Mr. Wulff, who stepped down in Feburary 2012 as prosecutors moved to strip him of his immunity from prosecution, had originally faced more serious charges of corruption. He is accused of allowing a film producer to pay nearly $1,000 of Mr. Wulffs expenses when he attended Oktoberfest in Munich in 2008, in exchange for lobbying the head of a major electronics company to back a project for which the producer was seeking financing.

Mr. Wulff, 54, was once seen as a great hope of the governing Christian Democratic Party, and even the editor the newspaper Bild, who received a threatening phone call from Mr. Wulff before publishing the first reports of irregularities, is now saying the former president has been punished enough.

Mr. Wulffs trial is expected to last into the spring and hear more than 40 witnesses. Mr. Wulff, who pleaded not guilty, has said he wants to clear his name. He rejected an offer from prosecutors to settle the case if he agreed to pay a fine of $27,000.
