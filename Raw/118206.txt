PARIS  The seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher was in critical condition after having brain surgery following a skiing accident in the French Alps on Sunday, doctors said.

Grenoble University Hospital Center said he arrived at the clinic in a coma. It was not clear whether he was still in a coma, but the hospital statement, which was signed by a neurosurgeon, an anesthesiologist and Marc Penaud, the hospitals deputy director, said he remains in a critical condition.

Schumacher, a 44-year-old German, fell during a backcountry run at the Mribel resort and hit his head on a rock, according to a statement from the resort.

Resort managers said he had been wearing a helmet and was conscious when rescuers first responded.

In an email, Schumachers manager, Sabine Kehm, said he was on a private skiing trip and fell on his head.

Schumachers 14-year-old son was skiing with him when the accident occurred, the resort said.

Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning five straight titles with Ferrari. He returned to the sport in 2010 and drove for three seasons without much success before retiring again last year.
