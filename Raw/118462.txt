ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar  Madagascan presidential candidate Jean Louis Robinson charges there was vote-rigging in the second round of elections on the island nation on Dec. 20.

The electoral commission's website showed Monday that, with 96 percent of the votes counted, Robinson's rival, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, has a clear lead with 53 percent of the vote and Robinson trailing with 46 percent.

But Robinson, appearing on two television channels Monday night, claimed he had evidence of many electoral "irregularities and failures."

Saraha Georget Rabearisoa, who threw her support behind Robinson after being eliminated in the first round of elections on Oct. 25 which produced no clear winner, also asserted "there has been massive fraud that can change the outcome of the election."

She said there are records and hard evidence to prove the fraud.
