Lost in the Storm: An 11-year-old girl reflects on all that she lost when her home in Tacloban, the Philippines, was devastated by a typhoon in November.

More than 6,000 people died during Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, many of them small children, vulnerable in the rising floodwater.

The video journalist Anne Lagamayo met Jhoanna Awaaw, 11, who lives in Barangay 61, a Tacloban neighborhood. She is the eldest of four surviving children who lost their mother and youngest sibling in the storm. Jhoanna lives with her family in the ruins of their seaside home, and her father collects shells and clams to sell. She is still struggling to understand the new realities of her life.

Earlier this month, The Timess Keith Bradsher wrote about a family of orphans who were feared victims of child trafficking but ended up safe in the care of an orphanage.
