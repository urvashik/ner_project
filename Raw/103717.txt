John Oliver has turned his widely praised stint this summer filling in for Jon Stewart on The Daily Show into a regular program of his own on HBO.

The network announced Thursday that Mr. Oliver, who will be leaving The Daily Show, would star in a topical, weekly comedy series to start sometime next year.

The description of the show makes it sound much like what Mr. Oliver has become known for on Comedy Central, where he has been a correspondent for The Daily Show since 2006: a satirical show focused on politics and current events.

HBO said Mr. Olivers new show would play on the networks feature night for original programming, Sunday.

During his summer as the anchor of The Daily Show when Mr. Stewart was in the Middle East directing a movie, Mr. Oliver racked up nearly universal raves. He has been the subject of some heated pursuit for his own show since then.
